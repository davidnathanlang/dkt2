# dkt2
Expanded implementation of DKT (https://github.com/chrispiech/DeepKnowledgeTracing), specificqally deisgned for using course engagement covariates as a project for CS230: Deep Learning (http://cs230.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University in Spring Quarter 2017-2018.

Code is designed for flexible command line specification of RNN model (simple RNN, GRU or LSTM) and dataset.  

The data folder contains a file called "tiny-test.csv" with an example of the input format.  The full datasete is from the Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning (https://iriss.stanford.edu/carol).  We are, unfortunately, not able to provide this data set to the public.

Data cleaning was done in STATA.
